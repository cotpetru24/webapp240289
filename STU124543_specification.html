            <h2>Objective/Goals</h2>
            
            <p>
                The main goal of the website is to be a one stop shop for users that are looking for activities, venues and attractions that are available in Coventry. It will include museums, monuments, restaurants, pubs, physical activities, intellectual activities and so on, it will be like a dashboard for the entire city. Website will allow users to make and manage booking for the activities, events or venues that they are interested in.
                
                Website will generate income from advertising, for example advertising upcoming events, newly opened venues and existing ones, as well as receiving a small percentage or a fixed rate from the amount payed by users for the bookings.
                
                The goal for the first three months is to achieve 1000 unique visitors and 100 bookings. 
                To achieve this the website has to be user friendly, intuitive and attractive. Another important factor is to ensure that the website is optimised for search engines, so that potential users can find it. 
                
                To increase sales in future, users will have the option to leave feedbacks and every three months user feedbacks and website statistics will be reviewed and website modified accordingly.
                
                The long-term goal is to ensure that venues are interested in being advertised on the website and to ensure that the website becomes an important part in life of people that live in the city and people that are visiting the city.

            <h2>Key audience</h2>
            <p>The website will be visited by males and females of all ages, but the main audience will be people with age between 25-50 years old, that are visiting the city or are not familiar with the city, and people that live locally and are looking for entertainment, for example new venue or events.
                Because the website will provide information about many types of activities that can be visited individually or with family, most likely users will be interested to visit the event and venues with the entire family.
                Most users will be living in UK, have a medium income and will use the site during the week to book activities for weekend from different mobile devices.
